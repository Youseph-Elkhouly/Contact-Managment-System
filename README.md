This project is a contact management system implemented in C. The program allows users to manage and search through a list of contacts stored in a database file. It supports various operations such as reading contact information from a file, searching for specific contacts by different criteria, and performing updates on the contact list.

The project uses multiple C source files (contactsA2.c, readContactsA2.c, searchContactsA2.c) to handle different parts of the functionality, such as reading contacts, searching contacts, and managing the overall contact list. A makefile is used to compile and link these files into an executable program (myContacts).

When running the program, the user provides a database file (contactsListA2.db) containing contact details. The program then performs operations on this data based on user input, such as searching for specific contacts or reading the contact list.

This system is a good example of file I/O operations, modular programming, and basic data management in C.
